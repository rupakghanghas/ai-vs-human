# AI vs Real Art Image Classification

This project is a **college capstone project** designed to classify images as **AI-generated art** or **Real art** using a fine-tuned MobileNetV2 model. The model utilizes transfer learning to achieve high accuracy and interpretability through Grad-CAM visualizations. The app has been deployed on **Streamlit Cloud** for public access, enabling users to upload images and receive predictions directly.

## üìì Kaggle Notebook

In this project, a Kaggle Notebook was used extensively for training, testing, and analyzing multiple models for classifying AI-generated and real art. Key points include:

- **Dataset Preparation:**
  - The dataset consisted of **27,266 training images** and **3,370 validation images**.
  - Divided into two sets: **AI-generated art** and **real art**.
  - Addressed class imbalance by experimenting with **class weights**.

- **Problem Formulation:**
  - The task was formulated as a **binary classification problem**: AI-generated vs. real art.
  - Leveraged **transfer learning** to enable cost-effective use of deep CNN architectures.

- **Model Experimentation:**
  - Experimented with **six CNN architectures**, including:
    - MobileNetV1 (focus model)
    - MobileNetV2
    - DenseNet121
    - InceptionV3
    - ResNet50
  - Fine-tuned models with optimized parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and class weights.

- **Key Insights:**
  - MobileNetV1 was prioritized for its reputation in transfer learning applications.
  - Both **MobileNetV1** and **MobileNetV2** performed exceptionally well, with closely comparable results.
  - MobileNetV2 was ultimately selected for deployment in the **Streamlit app** due to its **lightweight and scalable design**.

- **Training & Evaluation:**
  - Achieved a **training accuracy of 94.50%** and a **validation accuracy of 97.65%** with the best model.

- **Model Saving:**
  - Saved the fine-tuned **MobileNetV2 model** (`MobileNetV2_finetuned_model.keras`) for deployment.

- **Visualization & Interpretation:**
  - Used **Grad-CAM heatmaps** to interpret model predictions by highlighting image areas most relevant to classification.

This combination of methods showcases the project's potential to provide a robust solution for distinguishing between AI-generated and real artworks.
